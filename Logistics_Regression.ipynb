        "1.  What is Simple Linear Regression (SLR)? Explain its purpose.\n",
        "    - Simple Linear Regression (SLR) is a statistical technique used to model the linear relationship between a dependent variable (usually denoted as y) and a single independent variable (denoted as x). The purpose of SLR is to predict the value of the dependent variable based on the value of the independent variable, and to understand the strength and direction of the relationship between the two variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What are the key assumptions of Simple Linear Regression?\n",
        "    - Linearity: The relationship between the independent and dependent variable is linear.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Independence: The residuals (errors) are independent of each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Homoscedasticity: The variance of errors is constant across all levels of the independent variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Normality: The residuals are normally distributed.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Write the mathematical equation for a simple linear regression model and explain each term.\n",
        "    - The equation:\n",
        "     y=β0 + β1x + ϵ\n",
        "    - Where:y: Dependent variable (the target/output)\n",
        "    - x: Independent variable (the feature/input)\n",
        "    - β0: Intercept term (value of y when x=0)\n",
        "    - β1: Slope or regression coefficient (change in y corresponding to unit change in x)\n",
        "    - ϵ: Error term (difference between observed and predicted values)\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Provide a real-world example where simple linear regression can be\n",
        "applied.\n",
        "    - A real-world example is predicting a student's exam score based on the number of hours studied. The exam score is the dependent variable, and hours studied is the independent variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is the method of least squares in linear regression?\n",
        "    - The method of least squares is an approach for estimating the parameters (β0 , β1 ) of the regression line by minimizing the sum of the squared differences between observed and predicted values. It finds the line of best fit that reduces the total squared error.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is Logistic Regression? How does it differ from Linear Regression?\n",
        "    - Logistic Regression is used for classification problems where the outcome is categorical (e.g., binary: yes/no).\n",
        "\n",
        "    - It models the probability of the output belonging to a particular class using the logistic (sigmoid) function.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Linear Regression is used for regression problems where the outcome is continuous.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Difference: Linear regression predicts continuous values, logistic regression predicts probability of class membership.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.  Name and briefly describe three common evaluation metrics for regression models.\n",
        "    - Mean Squared Error (MSE): Average squared difference between observed and predicted values.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Average absolute difference between observed and predicted values.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - R-squared (R^2): Proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is the purpose of the R-squared metric in regression analysis?\n",
        "    - The R-squared metric quantifies how well the regression model explains the variability of the dependent variable. It ranges from 0 to 1, where higher values indicate a better fit, i.e., the model explains a larger proportion of the variance.\n",
